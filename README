Fluka VMC - VirtualMC implementation for FLUKA
==============================================

Licence:
--------

The ALICE code of Fluka VMC can of course be distributed freely. 
FLUKA is obtained via the standard licensing procedure described 
on the FLUKA web page. To be able to use Fluka VMC together with FLUKA, 
a special derogation must be asked to the FLUKA project. 
This procedure is not formalised, but it is a necessary step
in using of this package.


Files:
------
  README     - this file
  history    - the tags history
  source     - source code
  input      - common input files
	      
   
Environment:
------------
  Fluka VMC requires the Root and FLUKA installations.
  The paths to these installations are defined using their
  standard environment variables:

  ROOTSYS  - path to Root installation
  FLUPRO   - path to FLUKA installation
  FLUVMC   - path to Fluka VMC installation

  The load paths to shared libraries for Root and Fluka VMC
  have to be added to the environment variable  
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH - on Linux, Solaris, SGI, Alpha/OSF;
  SHLIB_PATH - on HP-UX.
    
Compilation:
------------
  Fluka VMC requires Root and FLUKA installation.
  Instructions for these installations can be found in their
  own documentation, they are not provided in this README. 

  cd fluka_vmc/source
  gmake

  Compilation targets:
  default    builds shared libraries
  static     builds static libraries
  clean      removes tmp
  cleanall   removes lib, tmp
  dist       creates tar file with distribution of source + binary files
  distsrc    creates tar file with distribution of source
  
  Note: dist, distsrc not yet available
  
Examples
============
  Several simple examples of usage of VMC are included in geant4_vmc. 
  In spite of being provided within Geant4 VMC, they are built independently 
  and do not require Geant4 installation in case you want to run them 
  with Geant3 or Fluka only.
  See more details in the README files provided with the examples sources.
  
  A shell script for preparing the working directory for
  running VMC application with FLUKA is provided with the examples
  (geant4_vmc/examples/macro/run_fluka.sh).
  It links all the necessary files in the working directory: 
  neuxsc.bin -> $FLUPRO/neuxsc_72.bin
  random.dat -> $FLUPRO/random.dat
  coreFlukaVmc.inp -> $FLUVMC/input/coreFlukaVmc.inp

  To build VMC examples libraries:
  cd geant4_vmc/examples
  gmake  

  To run examples:
  cd geant4_vmc/examples/E01
  root
  root [0] .x run_g3.C   // to run with Geant3
  root [0] .x run_g4.C   // to run with Geant4
  root [0] .x run_fl.C   // to run with Fluka
