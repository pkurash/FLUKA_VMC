Introduction
------------
  To demonstrate use of VirtualMC, four Geant4 novice
  examples (N01, N02, N03, N06) has been rewritten
  as VMC applications.
  
  For the complete description of the examples see:
  http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/examples

  Here we give only instructions how to run the exammples with Fluka.


Macros:
-------

  In all examples there are provided macro:
  
  run_fl.C        - macro for running example 
  flConfig.C      - configuration macro for Fluka
 
To run example:
---------------
  
  With Fluka:
  root[0] .x run_fl.C  
  
Test macros:
------------

  To test all possible configurations, there is provided a test
  macro for each examples

  test_En.C(const TString& configMacro, Bool_t oldGeometry)
     
  with parameters:
     - configMacro: configuration macro loaded in initialization 
     - oldGeometry: if true - geometry is defined via VMC, otherwise via TGeo
     
  The tests with all configurations can be run within
  the test suite:

  test_suite.sh
  
  which saves all test outputs in the files which names correspond
  to run configuration:
    test_fl_tgeo.out  - Fluka, geometry defined via TGeo
    test_fl_vmc.out   - Fluka, geometry defined via VMC

  The files are saved in log/E0n directory.
  The reference output files, which are updated with each release,
  can be found at log_ref directory.  
   
  All run_*.C macros can be run via run suite script:

  run_suite.sh
  
  which saves all output in run_*.out files.
